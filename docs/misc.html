              <h4>The League (Season 1, Episode 1)</h4>
              <p><strong>Pete:</strong><br>What's up everyone? I'm the current champion</p>
              <p>I'm here to tell you all about how I'm gonna win again</p>
              <p>By now you all know, how great I am at winnin'</p>
              <p>I did it three times, and it's only the fifth season</p>
              <p>It's cute how you all try, but you all just keep losin'</p>
              <p>Playin' trash like you I'm thinkin' about leavin'</p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Pete:</strong><br>Kevin, look at this. It's a nice shiny trophy</p>
              <p>Somehow if you win, then I'll pass it on to Jenny</p>
              <p><strong>Kevin:</strong><br>Shut your freakin' mouth Pete, she doesn't run my team</p>
              <p><strong>Jenny:</strong><br>Yeah, I'm just observing, it isn't what it seems</p>
              <p><strong>Pete:</strong><br>You can't possibly win the Shiva on your own</p>
              <p>I'd like to see how you do when Jenny isn't home</p>
              <p>Guiding and walking you all of the way</p>
              <p>Making notes to help you pick someone good on draft day</p>
              <p><strong>Kevin:</strong><br>Well I am the with a child and a wife</p>
              <p>How good have you been at handling your own life?</p>
              <p>Arguing and fighting with Meegan all day</p>
              <p>Don't even want to make Meegan a madre</p>
              <p><strong>Pete:</strong><br>I'm the one with the trophy and I know you want it bad</p>
              <p>Cuz if it's yours, it will be the only good thing you ever had</p>
              <p>Now take your hands off the Shiva and put them away</p>
              <p>While I go outside to make fun of our dumb friend Andre</p>
              <p><strong>Pete:</strong><br>Andre, have you ever done it with a trophy?</p>
              <p><strong>Andre:</strong><br>No but I can't wait cuz it's making me horny</p>
              <p><strong>Pete:</strong><br>I guess it's possible, maybe now you're better</p>
              <p>Maybe this time, you won't draft a commentator</p>
              <p><strong>Andre:</strong><br>So you got in my head once, it won't happen again</p>
              <p>But when the Shiva's in my house you won't be laughing then</p>
              <p>Bring it into my bed and get your sloppy seconds</p>
              <p>I'm gonna suck it, and dry hump the Shiva the legend</p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Meegan:</strong><br>Jenny, how are you? You look like you need some drinks</p>
              <p><strong>Jenny:</strong><br>No, we're trying to have a baby, so thanks but no thanks</p>
              <p>We've been trying for a while, a month actually</p>
              <p><strong>Meegan:</strong><br>Clearly, Kevin doesn't have any slow swimmers, does he?</p>
              <p><strong>Pete:</strong><br>Excuse me, how would you know if a man has slow swimmers?</p>
              <p>How do you know that my swimmers aren't strong winners?</p>
              <p><strong>Meegan:</strong><br>You just scoooop it up and get to the bottom</p>
              <p>After you pull out, I clean it, and start looking at 'em</p>
              <p><strong>Pete:</strong><br>Mine wouldn't be so slow if you respect some boundaries</p>
              <p>Puttin' your finger in my ass, where it's not supposed to be</p>
              <p>I don't know what you're thinking, but I'm just not ready</p>
              <p>Just keep your hands away from that part of my body</p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Ruxin:</strong><br>Hey Kevin, who you picking? Too bad you're sixth pick</p>
              <p>You don't have options, so it's ok to feel a little sick</p>
              <p>My first pick is the wonderful Adrian Peterson</p>
              <p>Those shoebox calves and that chestnut-black skin</p>
              <p>Also got the Oracle, advising me to the win</p>
              <p>Together, we're gonna make it the year of the Ruxin</p>
              <p><strong>Kevin:</strong><br>Stop talking already, we've got work to do</p>
              <p><strong>Ruxin:</strong><br>Yeah I bet that's what Jenny says when she runs the team for you</p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Kevin:</strong><br>Mr. Gomez, nice to meet you, I represent the state</p>
              <p>There's evidence to put you away for ten years straight</p>
              <p><strong>Ruxin:</strong><br>Wait a minute now, Ernie's innocent</p>
              <p>Ernie did you do it?</p>
              <p><strong>Ernie:</strong><br>No</p>
              <p><strong>Ruxin:</strong><br>There, he didn't</p>
              <p><strong>Kevin:</strong><br>Are you serious? There's video of him on camera!</p>
              <p>All three liquor stores saying hi to his momma!</p>
              <p>Ruxin, your client's going away for ten years</p>
              <p>Unless...</p>
              <p><strong>Ruxin:</strong><br>What?</p>
              <p><strong>Kevin:</strong><br>I'm glad I have your ears</p>
              <p>I'm willing to give him seven for your first round pick</p>
              <p><strong>Ruxin:</strong><br>What the hell is this? No way! Let me rethink</p>
              <p>He goes for five years and we swap first rounds</p>
              <p><strong>Kevin:</strong><br>We have a deal. Hah! See you around!</p>
              <p><strong>Ruxin:</strong><br>Thanks Ernie I just lost Adrian Peterson</p>
              <p>You've gone and ruined my life now, I'm just sayin'</p>
              <p>You went to the third store. Are you freakin' insane?</p>
              <p>Obviously more stuff was no good for your brain</p>
              <p>Just steal from one, I did it last week!</p>
              <p>Just keep the crime small, keep it short and sweet!</p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Ruxin:</strong><br>Ok, Oracle. What about Jay Cutler?</p>
              <p><strong>Oracle:</strong><br>Him? You're better off picking your own mother</p>
              <p><strong>Ruxin:</strong><br>Ok, tell me this: How's Larry Johnson?</p>
              <p><strong>Oracle:</strong><br>That's a great pick! If you think last place is awesome!</p>
              <p>You know what you're trash. What did I get into?</p>
              <p>I should just leave cuz I do not wanna help you</p>
              <p><strong>Ruxin:</strong><br>Wait, you haven't done anything for me at all</p>
              <p>Won't even tell me who will play good football</p>
              <p><strong>Oracle:</strong><br>I want to go home</p>
              <p><strong>Ruxin:</strong><br>Well not without my jersey</p>
              <p>You can keep it if you stay here, be useful, and help me</p>
              <p><strong>Oracle's Dad:</strong><br>Ruxin! What the hell are you doing?!</p>
              <p>Let go of my son before I give you a good beating</p>
              <p>You break into my home and kidnap my son</p>
              <p>I will destroy you, and won't stop when I'm done</p>
              <p>You're a sick pervert and you should go to jail</p>
              <p>No, actually, you belong in hell</p>
              <p><strong>Ruxin:</strong><br>I -</p>
              <p><strong>Oracle's Dad:</strong><br>Shut your mouth and get out of my face</p>
              <p>Now leave, before I go and put you in your place</p>

              <p><strong>Pete:</strong><br>Our relationship is completely over now</p>
              <p>Got me an apartment and I'm gonna move out</p>
              <p><strong>Ruxin:</strong><br>You know, your breakup's causing ripple effects</p>
              <p>Because of you, my wife and I aren't having sex</p>
              <p><strong>Pete:</strong><br>Oh I'm sorry for being inconsiderate</p>
              <p>But you're just gonna have to go and get used to it</p>
              <p><strong>Kevin:</strong><br>Why don't you just jerk off, why don't you just masturbate?</p>
              <p><strong>Ruxin:</strong><br>Can't have porn in the house and my imagination isn't great</p>
              <p><strong>Kevin:</strong><br>I don't have that problem, made a deal with Jenny</p>
              <p>I can watch anything if I'm working out, gettin' sweaty</p>
              <p><strong>Ruxin:</strong><br>My balls are so heavy, it's like carrying a huge brick</p>
              <p>If I don't cum soon, I'm gon' be physically sick</p>

              <p><strong>Ruxin:</strong><br>Tell me, is it confidence or vaginal hubris?</p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Andre:</strong><br>Pete, let me help you get back in the game</p>
              <p>It's been 8 years so nothin' is the same</p>
              <p>You can't just go up to a girl anymore</p>
              <p>You gotta hang back and neg her some more</p>
              <p>Watch this, nice pants, makes your butt look fat</p>
              <p><strong>Pete:</strong><br>Yeah, she really hates you for that</p>
              <p><strong>Andre:</strong><br>For now, but at midnight she's gon' come crawling back</p>
              <p><strong>Pete:</strong><br>Sorry man but this negging thing is just a setback</p>
              <p><strong>Andre:</strong><br>If you're not gonna do negging, then do some cool magic</p>
              <p><strong>Pete:</strong><br>What's your success rate? It's probably pretty tragic</p>
              <p><strong>Taco:</strong><br>Sup boys, Dr. Dre and Pete</p>

              <p><strong>Andre:</strong><br>Wait, what the heck is an Eskimo brother?</p>
              <p><strong>Taco:</strong><br>It's when two guys have sex with the same lover</p>
              <p>That's how we brothers get to know each other</p>
              <p>You gotta know your Eskimo family tree</p>
              <p>It's how you get things done easily</p>

              <p>Hard to go to the gym but I gotta stay fitter</p>
              <p>Bouncing around gotta buy a new sports bra</p>
              <p><strong>Ruxin:</strong><br>What's that?</p>
              <p><strong>Sofia:</strong><br>A bounce test video, pretty cool huh?</p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Ruxin:</strong><br>Pete, your selfishness has cost me my pleasure</p>
              <p>You almost prevented me from ejaculating ever</p>
              <p>But I have just found a nice little loophole</p>
              <p>It comes in the form of a bounce test video</p>
              <p>Now the woman has no head but that's alright</p>
              <p>It's the closest thing to porn that'll make things all right</p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Ruxin:</strong><br>Jenny, let me tell you what's really going on</p>
              <p>I'm on the internet but I'm doin' nothin' wrong</p>
              <p>I'm supporting my wife, who's dealing with her body</p>
              <p>Her breasts are real swollen, but they're really not shoddy</p>
              <p><strong>Jenny:</strong><br>Ruxin, shut up! I know exactly what you're doin'</p>
              <p>You're watching those videos so you could get off jerkin'</p>
              <p><strong>Ruxin:</strong><br>Fine! What's it gonna take for you to not tell Sofia?</p>
              <p><strong>Jenny:</strong><br>Payton Manning sounds like a really good idea</p>
              <p><strong>Ruxin:</strong><br>You really do run your husband's team for him don't ya?</p>
              <p><strong>Jenny:</strong><br>No word about this meeting and I won't tell Sofia</p>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Andre:</strong><br>You know we probably have a lot of Eskimo connections</p>
              <p><strong>Pete:</strong><br>No, I don't think our family tree crosses the same directions</p>
              <p><strong>Taco:</strong><br>Well maybe we could be Eskimo brothers</p>
              <p><strong>Andre:</strong><br>Yeah? Who do you know?</p>
              <p><strong>Taco:</strong><br>Ummm have you slept with your sister befo'?</p>
              <p><strong>Andre:</strong><br>Wait, how did that even happen we were really really young</p>
              <p>When she was a senior we were just freshman, high school had just begun</p>
              <p>You must have been how old? Like, what, 13?</p>
              <p><strong>Taco:</strong><br>12</p>
              <p><strong>Pete:</strong><br>Yeah I remember sleeping with Andre's sister too!</p>
              <p>I guess Andre is the only one who never really knew</p>
              <p><strong>Andre:</strong><br>What!?</p>
              <p><strong>Pete and Taco:</strong><br>Eskimo brothers!</p>
