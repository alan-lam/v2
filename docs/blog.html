	    <p>Another day. Another assignment. Another math problem. And he had his head down again.</p>
	    <p>"M! You're trying to sleep right now? I swear, I see you sleep in sixth period all the time.", said K.</p>
	    <p>Wait what's your sixth period?" I was just trying to get a conversation started.</p>
	    <div class="collapse" id="collapseEmptyingtheCup">
	      <p>"Physics. Like, literally, he just has his head down and sleeps through the whole class."</p>
	      <p>"Hey, physics is hard, man. I don't understand anything in that class."</p>
	      <p>"Yeah, physics is hard. I dropped out of that class when I took it."</p>
	      <p>"Really? <i>You</i> think physics is hard?", M asked.</p>
	      <p>"Yeah."</p>
	      <p>"Do you have any advice for me?"</p>
	      <p>"Advice about what?"</p>
	      <p>"Advice for physics."</p>
	      <p>"You just gotta memorize all the formulas.", said G.</p>
              <p>"Yeah, physics is a lot of math."</p>
              <p>"It is! And I'm not that good at math.", said M.</p>
              <p>"Well, my advice to you is to go ask your teacher for help. Like during lunch or afterschool or something. Just go into his room and ask him for help."</p>
	      <p>"But I don't wanna go in there and have it be all like, 'What do you need help with?' 'Everything!'"</p>
              <p>"Yeah, that's why you go now. You start early so he doesn't have to go through so much."</p>
              <p>"Ok, I'll try going early. I'm not good at school. I don't know what I want to do with my life."</p>
              <p>"Well, what do you like to do at home?"</p>
              <p>"Sleep!"</p>
              <p>"Ok, what about when you're not sleeping?"</p>
              <p>"Play video games."</p>
              <p>"What video games do you play?"</p>
              <p>"Fortnite."</p>
              <p>"Hey, I used to play Fortnite too."</p>
              <p>"But then you had to focus on life and stuff, huh?"</p>
              <p>"Yeah. That and I wasn't that great at it."</p>
              <p>"Yeah, see. I still don't know what to do in the future."</p>
              <p>"What subjects do you like then? Like, English or history?"</p>
              <p>"I don't really like anything. It's just easy or hard. That's it. Like, I don't like English, but it's easy. I don't think anyone likes any subject."</p>
              <p>"I like math.", said G.</p>
              <p>"Really? You <i>like</i> math? You use it at home?" M was skeptical. Admittedly, I was a bit too at first, but still ready to make a case for G.</p>
              <p>"Yeah, I use it all the time when I draw. Like, I just keep drawing patterns and measuring stuff. It's all patterns."</p>
              <p>"I like the way you put it.", said M.</p>
              <p>"Yeah, I want to go into art when I grow up."</p>
              <p>"You know, I put this all on myself. I'm the one that cares about doing good in school. Like, not even my parents care."</p>
              <p>"They actually tell you they don't care? Or you can tell that they don't care?"</p>
              <p>"I can tell they don't care. They don't tell me to do good in school. They just be like, 'just do yo thing'."</p>
              <p>"Well, why do you care about doing good in school?"</p>
              <p>"Because I don't want to be messed up, you know? Like, work hard now so I can relax later, you know?"</p>

	    <p>He stared at the door. The door stared back at him. He put his hand on the handle. Then he took it off. He wasn't nervous before, but being one step away brought the reality of it all back to him. One step away from a totally new world. At that moment, he wished he was home. Not just his apartment several miles away. But back home. Where the smell of his favorite foods was always in the air. Where all his favorite places were just around the corner. Where all the people he saw were familiar faces. Where he felt at home.</p>
	    <p>He put his hand on the handle once again and slowly pushed the door forward.</p>
	    <div class="collapse" id="collapseBarnga">
	      <p>All eyes turned on him. Their paralyzing stares held him in place. In an attempt to avoid them, he looked around the room, darting his eyes back and forth, focusing on nothing in particular. As long as he couldn't see their eyes drilling into him, he felt a bit calmer. A bit less alien. He didn't know where to go though, so he stood there fixed in place until he saw the teacher motion for him to take a seat in an empty chair. He sat down. On his left, a student turned to him and acknowledged him with a simple <i>"hey"</i>. He didn't understand but smiled back politely anyway.</p>
              <p>Before he could adjust to his new surroundings, the teacher continued talking. He didn't understand, but smiled back politely whenever the teacher looked his way. For a brief minute, he finally felt comfortable. Now that he was where he was supposed to be, he could focus on moving forward. But the brief comfort gave way to worry. What happens now? What's supposed to happen? What do I do next?</p>
              <p>He didn't know the rules. Was he allowed to raise his hand for assistance? Judging by everyone's silence, he probably wasn't allowed to talk. Which was probably a good thing since he didn't know what to say anyway.</p>
              <p>All of a sudden, the teacher stopped talking. He looked around and saw several hands go up. Was he supposed to raise his hand too? One student spoke and the teacher smiled and nodded, seemingly in agreement and approval. What did she say? What did the teacher ask? He felt his face getting warmer. What if he was the only one who didn't know the answer?</p>
              <p>The anxiety. The confusion. The embarrassment. The swirl of emotions rushing through his head and chest made him feel sick inside. He couldn't take it anymore. Without warning, he jumped out of his seat and ran out of the classroom. He didn't know where he was running to, but he just wanted to get as far away from the classroom as possible. The tears forming in his eyes made it hard for him to see. He turned a corner and crashed into someone. Quickly, he got up and started apologizing repeatedly. He didn't stop to think that the person probably wouldn't understand him. He just kept apologizing.</p>
              <p><i>"Stop it already. I'm fine. How about you, are you ok?"</i></p>
              <p>He didn't answer. Not because he didn't understand what he was saying. But because he actually understood what he was saying. It was the first time he heard someone speak his language since coming to school. Wiping away the tears from his eyes, he smiled at him and said, <i>"Yeah, everything's ok now."</i></p>

            <h4 class="title">Language Barriers</h4>
            <h6 class="date">October 26, 2018</h6>
            <p>(Note: I use double quotes for thoughts and spoken words and single quotes for written and typed words.)</p>
            <p>Today was the first time I truly met a student dealing with a language barrier. It was interesting, to say the least.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseLanguageBarrier">
              <p>I knew that being in a community where the minorities were a majority meant that English might not have been some students' first language. But that had never seemed to be a major problem for me or the students before. Admittedly, I tend to assume every student can speak and understand English enough to learn the material.</p>
              <p>2nd period started with the teacher handing out to each student a paper with grid coordinates on it and a line. Their task: find the slope of the line and draw a line with slope 2/5. I walked around the room, looking at how students solved the problem. Most were drawing horizontal and vertical lines from one point on the line to another point on the line. Some correctly concluded that the slope was 3/1 or 3. Others mixed up the definition of slope and got 1/3. One student's paper caught my eye in particular. She had drawn two triangles, but it wasn't apparent what they were for or what they were measuring. Just two arbitrary triangles on the line. At first I thought, "Wow, I've never seen anyone solve for slope like this."</p>
              <p>When the students were done, they went to the back of the classroom and put their paper in one of three boxes. One was labeled: 'I understand the material and could teach it to someone else'. Most of the students who finished early put their papers in this box. Most of them were right. The second box was labeled something along the lines of: 'I almost understand the material, but I'm still a little fuzzy'. Some of the papers in this box were right. The third box was labeled: 'I don't understand the material'. This box had the fewest papers. When I looked at the top one, the paper turned out to be the one with the two triangles. Maybe she didn't know what the triangles were for either.</p>
              <p>After this, the teacher had students get laptops. I wasn't sure what they needed them for. I didn't really pay too much attention to it. Some time later, the teachers paired up students to work with each other on the slope problem they were doing earlier. The students who got the correct answer got matched with those who got the wrong answer. The students who got the correct answer were leaders who helped their partner by asking guided questions to help them think about how to solve the problem.</p>
              <p>In my casual stroll around the room, I ended up near the student who had drawn triangles. Sitting around her were two other girls, who appeared to be trying to help her. I walked closer to them to observe. I looked at the laptop in front of them, and it was open to Google Translate. What was more shocking was the language they were translating to. 'What is the slope of the line?' translated into a collection of swirly symbols I had never seen before. That's when I realized the student who had drawn triangles - the student who had put her paper in the 'I don't understand the material' box - didn't understand English.</p>
              <p>I watched in awe as the girls tried to get her to copy one of their papers to show her how to do the problem. The magnitude of the situation was overwhelming. She doesn't understand what the teacher and her classmates are saying, and there's nobody around who spoke Amharic.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the girls' efforts weren't successful. When the teacher decided to move on, I asked if I could work with her individually. Upon his approval, I sat down next to her and opened up Google Translate on my phone.</p>
              <p>Before, when I was watching the girls help her, I had a suspicion that she didn't know what a line was, which was pretty important because the definition of slope - as they were taught - is vertical length / horizontal length. I typed into Google Translate: 'Do you know what a line is?'. She shook her head. I drew a line on her paper. "This is a line". Repeating the pencil motion, I repeated, "line". Softly, she repeated, "line". 'Can you draw a line?'. She drew a line on her paper just as I had.</p>
              <p>"How long is the line?". She looked at me blankly. 'How long is the line?'. Still no response. I drew two points on the line and told her that it was "1". I drew another point and asked her again. "2". "From here to here?". "3". I drew another line. "How long is this line?". 'How long is this line?'. "4". "How long is this line?". "1".</p>
              <p>She now seemed to be able to measure the length of lines. Then I wanted to make sure she understood the concept of horizontal lines and vertical lines. 'Do you know what horizontal means?'. She nodded. 'Do you know what vertical means?'. She nodded again. "What type of line is this? Is it horizontal or vertical?". No response. I asked again, this time moving my pencil in the corresponding motion. "Horizontal? Or vertical?". "Horizontal", she replied softly. I pointed to a vertical line. "Horizontal? Or vertical?". "Vertical".</p>
              <p>I moved on to the concept of points. 'Do you know what a point is?'. She shook her head. I drew a point on her paper. "This is a point.". "Point". 'Can you draw a point?'. She successfully drew a dot on the paper. Sliding my finger along the line, I asked, "Can you draw a point on this line?". 'Can you draw a point on this line?'. She drew a (good) point on the line. I was ecstatic. "Can you draw another point on this line?". She then drew a (bad) point on the line. My heart dropped. Well, at least it was on the line. I had absolutely no idea how to explain that the points she should be drawing had to be on the line <b>and</b> where the grid points were.</p>
              <p>The teacher then told everyone to pack up. Quickly, I moved back to lines and lengths. "How long is this line?". 'How long is this line?'. "4", she said. "Is it horizontal or vertical?". "Vertical". I made the up-down-left-right motion and asked again, "Horizontal or vertical?". "Horizontal". "How long is this line?". "3". "Horizontal or vertical?". "Vertical".</p>
              <p>With that I ended our little session and she packed up and left. That session was pretty enlightening though. I never realized how hard it was for non-native English speakers to learn. I never realized how hard it was to teach someone who didn't speak English.</p>

            <h6 class="date">October 22, 2018</h6>
            <p>Imagine you're sledding down a hill with your favorite stuffed tiger. Those familiar with the reference will know that this hill is dangerous. There are many trees and rocks you have to avoid. Being the amazing six-year-old that you are, you manage to avoid them in the beginning. Also, being the philosophical six-year-old that you are, you're probably busy asking your companion deep questions about life. Too busy to notice the ledge. Of course, you fall off of it. And the comic would end with you buried face-flat under the snow and pinning the blame on your tiger.</p>
            <p>But I'm not Bill Watterson so this comic takes a different turn.</p>
            <p>Somehow, the sled breaks into two when it lands on the ground and you're standing on both pieces, one foot on each side. Then, by some unfortunate phenomenon, the ground below you splits, leaving a giant fissure between your feet.</p>
            <p>Now you're speeding down a hill essentially on two different paths. What now?</p>

            <h6 class="date">September 29, 2018</h6>
            <p>The familiar feeling grabs a hold of me. It's the feeling of excitement mixed with longing. It's the feeling of "I can't wait!" and "Just one more week. Please!"</p>
            <p>It's like an ocean suddenly in high tide. Without even realizing it, I somehow got dragged so far out. And with every passing second, I end up deeper in the ocean. Exceeding the line of balance between excitement and fear. Excitement because I'm adventurous, but fear because I'm not that great at swimming. So before I'm too deep, I try to swim back to shore. To comfort.</p>
            <p>But everytime the waves ebb away, they push me back out. Like I'm not allowed to be where I once was.</p>
            <p>Here I am now, stranded out at sea. It's calm and quiet. It's peaceful. Heck, it even smells nice. It'll do. But I know pretty soon, the waves will push me back to shore. It always has.</p>
            <p>I guess I better enjoy it while I can. This might be my last time going out to sea.</p>

            <p>I like the little intricacies of English like the way someone might go to an art museum just to seem "cultured" rather than for the art itself.</p>
            <p>I'll say I like English/grammar/writing, but I'll probably not be able to analyze any piece of writing smartly.</p>
            <p>Ironic? Actually, maybe not. Oh well.</p>

            <h6 class="date">September 10, 2018</h6>
            <p>So I had to replace some kitchen countertop tiles recently. It was hard, to say the least. Keep in mind that I have no experience whatsoever with stuff like this.</p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/blog/tile_start.jpg">
            <p>I have no idea when and how that ever happened. To make things worse, I have no idea where the piece went.</p>
            <p>For some reason, my mind jumped to making a crescent-shaped piece somehow. It would've been much easier to glue it on than to remove and replace the tiles.</p>
            <p>But alas, there were no crescent-shaped tiles.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseTiled">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/blog/tile_mid_1.jpeg">
              <p>Yep. By removing one tile, I made the problem worse. The hole - originally spanning across two tiles - now spanned across three tiles. Great. Just great.</p>
              <p>Removing one tile was hard enough. I mean, have you ever tried "sawing" through a rock with scissors? I imagine it's probably something like that.</p>
              <p>It's also hard mentally as well. It's demoralizing when you're sawing and prying away at a broken tile - which you never broke by the way - only to break pieces off of the perfectly good tiles next to it. Well, then you would have to take off those freshly ruined tiles. And oops. You just inevitably broke more pieces off of more good tiles next to those freshly ruined tiles.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/blog/tile_mid_2.jpg">
              <p>That was the third most satisfying thing to see in this whole experience.</p>
              <p>Did you know that it is difficult finding a store that stocks v-cap tiles in the size you need? That was the second most satisfying thing to see.</p>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/blog/tile_end.jpg">
              <p>And that was the most satisfying thing to see.</p>
              <p>P.S. Thanks to my roommate for believing in me (in a very indirect way). Without his support and guidance, this would not be possible.</p>

            <p>Reading through a somewhat recent email, I came across the word "anyway". The first time I had ever seen it used.</p>
            <p>I dismissed it the first time I read it. I really don't know why it didn't sound weird at the time. Anyways. Anyway. It sounds so weird without the 's'.</p>
            <p>Well, I just found out that "anyway" is actually correct, making "anyways" incorrect.</p>
            <p>Apparently, it's because "anyway" is an adverb, and adverbs can't be plural.</p>
            <p>Anyway, it's reminiscent of Kent Davison describing Daylight Saving Time: "It's neither plural nor possessive."</p>

            <p>Maybe it's because I didn't like dancing. Well I've never danced before (this class), so I guess I can't really say that.</p>
            <p>Maybe it's because dancing is difficult. But then again, everything is difficult in the beginning.</p>
            <p>Maybe it's because I was worried about other people's (nonexistent) judgements. Well, that kinda went out the window when I cut my hair the way I did.</p>
            <p>Maybe it's because it required a surprisingly good amount of mental energy to do seemingly simple movements. Oh. Yeah. It. Did.</p>

            <p>A speck of snow falls from the sky, slowly drifting down towards the earth. It lands on his nose. He's shocked. Then pleasantly surprised. He looks up, expecting more snow flakes. But there are none.</p>
            <p>Lately, I've been taking a page out of someone's book and going to restaurants by myself. It feels a bit weird walking into a restaurant alone and seeing families or groups of friends or couples seated at the tables. It feels a bit weird holding up my finger and saying "one" when I'm asked, "How many people?"</p>
            <p>I imagine it looks a bit weird to other people too. But I've stopped caring about what other people think of me since I cut my hair.</p>
            <p>He brings his hand to his nose and wipes the snowflake off. He looks up at the sky once more, hoping to see more snowflakes. Then he wakes up. Of course it was just a dream. Snow in the summer is just a bit weird.</p>

            <h6 class="date">August 6, 2018</h6>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/alan-lam/Problem-Sets" target="_blank">I've been coding a lot in Racket lately.</a> Not for ThoughtSTEM, but for my own practice. I've mentioned several times - well, at least once anyways - that functional programming seemed hard to me. I might've also suggested that I didn't like Racket and functional programming.</p>
            <p>Well, I suppose you already know what this post is gonna be about.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseRacketeering">
              <p>I've also mentioned before that my mind about functional programming might change. It definitely is a change of pace. And a completely different way of thinking.</p>
              <p>The problems I've been solving were intended to be solved primarily in Java. At least, I think so, because they're from a beginner's programming competition at UCSD, and the first language you learn at UCSD is Java.</p>
              <p>I haven't done a whole bunch yet, but for most of the problems, I kept thinking about how much easier it would be to do them in an imperative style. (Another reason why I think they're intended to be solved using Java.) If you see a question involving checking whether a string has a character, one of the first thoughts to pop into your mind would probably be creating a simple loop to traverse the string and check each character. Easy-peasy.</p>
              <p>It's a bit frustrating when I hit a roadblock and I think, "This would be so much easier with a loop." or "This would be so much easier with variables." But forcing myself to turn away from those has improved my coding skills.</p>
              <p>For one, I am much more comfortable with recursion now. For some reason, I used to never be able to wrap my head around (and around and around and around) recursion. I mean, I knew that you needed a base case and a recursive call with a smaller input, but I never knew what to put for the base case and/or input. And the whole "going up the stack" or whatever used to confuse me too. (I was relieved when my professor said that loops are generally preferred over recursion because it's easier to debug a loop.)</p>
              <p>Another thing is that the code is more concise. Having outputs of functions be inputs of other functions make for a lot of one-liners. I mean, one-liners aren't necessarily signs of good code, but resorting to higher-level functions (I kinda am referring to higher-order functions and kinda not at the same time) that strip away the details of lower-level stuff, like loops and variable manipulations, sometimes makes code easier to understand than the lower-level code, which become confusing simply because there are so many lines. (E.g. recursively traversing a tree vs. looping through a tree.)</p>
              <p>With that said, I still don't see myself switching over to functional programming. It's a little bit like writing in cursive: it's not really done on a large scale (I don't think) and print writing is easier anyways. (Also like functional programming, cursive is arguably the better writing technique but harder to read.) I definitely do <a href="#see_how_it_works">see how it works</a> though. A little bit more anyways.</p>

            <h6 class="date">July 26, 2018</h6>
            <p>That's not to say that learning programming languages is pointless. Just that computer science knowledge/expertise shouldn't be measured by the number or popularity of languages one knows. (Except for Matlab and HTML/CSS. Those aren't "real" programming languages. According to jokes anyways lol.)</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseLearningHowToCodeP2">
              <p>Especially with the high school students, most of whom having had significant programming experience (is that grammatically correct? I suspect not.), getting through a module/quest has been very easy because they easily understood what was going on. While one other student has said Racket was easier than imperative programming languages, I think they were getting it not because of the "easiness" of Racket, but because of something else. (I still don't think Racket is easier than imperative programming languages, but that's my heavily biased - and somewhat stubborn - opinion.)</p>
              <p>Because of something else. What is that something else? It lies in (one of) the goal(s) of Morugamu, which aims to teach computer science without the computer. It sounds weird, doesn't it? Maybe because learning computer science seems to be associated with learning how to work/talk with computers or knowing how to code in a dozen programming languages. But knowing how to do those things requires something more basic. Ah, there's that "something" again.</p>
              <p>Admittedly, I've imagined scenarios involving confused (at the least) parents wondering about why their children weren't learning Python or whatever when Python - or whatever - was in the name of the class. I don't think my answer is better than that of whoever is answering that question.</p>
              <p>My response would've been 'something' like, "learning how to code is more about developing logical reasoning skills - and, more generally, developing a programming mindset - than learning a language."</p>
              <p>Ah, there's that "something" again.</p>

            <p>As it gets further into the week - and ultimately into the summer - my thoughts on learning computer science - and what it actually is - are slowly changing.</p>
            <p>When I found out I would be helping out with camps teaching Python and Java and virtual reality and Android apps and web design, I didn't think it would all be done in Racket. I imagine the students didn't think that either. Oh, and their parents too, of course.</p>
            <p>I initially thought that was unfortunate for the students. I mean, they're working with a language they're unlikely to see or use again; and if they were to learn Java or Python, their experience with Racket wouldn't really be of much use. The same way learning a language that compiles to Javascript isn't the same as learning Javascript.</p>
            <p>But I watched the students learn. I watched them vigorously copying code from the slides. I watched them work through their errors and learn from their mistakes. And I watched them create awesome things from whole worlds to explore in virtual reality to creative websites featuring their favorite games or TV shows, and proudly showing them off to everyone.</p>
            <p>They were just getting familiar with the material and then running off with their imagination to build whatever they desired.</p>
            <p>Which, I think, is what learning how to code is really about.</p>

            <p>As a CS undergrad, you should try to learn a language that isn't used in industry. Sounds like crippling advice to me.</p>
            <p>Don't get me wrong, I don't disagree with this. I agree to some extent. Also, I don't mean to offend the person who said this. (I actually greatly admire him.) It just seems counterintuitive at first.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseIndustry">
              <p>I guess it's because, from my perspective, going to college for a CS degree means gaining the skills necessary to work in industry. I.e. college is a job-preparation thing for students pursuing a CS degree.</p>
              <p>The opposite would be college is a place for learning as much as possible for the sake of learning rather than for the sake of getting a job. Being a Math-CS major, I've experienced both sides of the spectrum.</p>
              <p>I say it's crippling advice because I imagine telling CS students to learn a language not used in industry and seeing them balk at the idea. They would probably call it a waste of time because they could've used that time to learn something "useful". Or maybe they would say that it makes them undesirable because they know some no-name language while everyone around them is scribbling away in Python, Java, C, C++, Javascript.</p>
              <p>Everyone will inadvertently have to be better than the next CS student to get a job in industry. And how do they get a job in industry? By working with the tools used in industry. After all, if you're a company working primarily with Java, you would want to hire someone experienced in Java. I presume.</p>
              <p>And, also, if we don't get a job by the time we graduate, our lives are officially over. Heh.</p>

            <h4 class="title">Brought to You Today by the Number 9 (and by the letters C and S)</h4>
            <h6 class="date">July 18, 2018</h6>
            <p>For the past 3 weeks, I've been riding my skateboard or bike - depending on the week - to get the mail. This week is skateboard week. Today, however, I came home a bit late and decided to walk instead.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseNine">
              <p>My skateboard is kinda loud already and riding over cracks in the sidewalk just makes it even louder. It was a little after 8:30, so I thought maybe there were children sleeping - or getting ready to go to sleep. (I suspect that the area I live in is half families and half students.) I have no idea if that is true; I only thought that because I remember I had to go to bed around 9 when I was younger.</p>
              <p>It was about 10-13 years ago, but I remember that because I would lie in bed and stare at my digital clock. It wasn't because I couldn't sleep; it was because I was doing mental math with the numbers on the clock. Specifically, division. I don't remember if I liked doing division or not, but, for some reason, I stayed up doing it. The numbers were aligned so that I could imagine a division bar (whatever it's called) between the hour and the minutes and do division by 9.</p>
              <p>I did this so often that I eventually came up with an algorithmic way of dividing (two digit) numbers by 9. It went something along the lines of: the first digit of the quotient is going to be the first digit of the dividend. So, for 23 &divide; 9, the first digit of the answer is going to be 2. For 34 &divide; 9, the first digit of the answer is 3. I was excited about my discovery until the time was something like 9:29.</p>
              <p>I modified my algorithm: if the digits of the dividend add up to 9 or greater, then the first digit of the quotient is going to be 1 greater than the first digit of the dividend. So, for 29 &divide; 9, the first digit of the answer is going to be 3, since 2 + 9 = 11 &ge; 9.</p>
              <p>For the second digit, it was the sum of the digits of the dividend. So, for 23 &divide; 9, the in-progress answer would be 2.5 since 2 + 3 = 5. For 34 &divide; 9, the in-progress answer would be 3.7 since 3 + 4 = 7. For edge cases, like 29 &divide; 9, the in-progress answer would be 3.2 since 2 + 9 = 11 and 1 + 1 = 2. For 58 &divide; 9, the in-progress answer would be 6.4 since 5 + 8 = 13 and 1 + 3 = 4.</p>
              <p>I don't think I was able to stay up after 9:58.</p>
              <p>It was by creating that algorithm (especially the second digit part) that I inadvertently memorized single digit division by 9. 1/9 = .111..., 2/9 = .222..., 7/9 = .777...</p>
              <p>What I didn't realize - until now (almost literally) - was that I was using fundamental computer science concepts in creating my algorithm. Well, first of all, by creating an algorithm. But also by using "if statements" for special cases. And also by generalizing the algorithm so that it worked for any digits. It worked as long as I was in bed and awake between 9:10 and 9:59 anyways.</p>
              <p>It wasn't a very useful algorithm. (I'm pretty proud of it though lol.) But it was fascinating to me at the time. What's most surprising to me is that I developed that way of thinking with no exposure to computer science. Well, whatever computer science is.</p>

            <h4 class="title">See How It Works?</h4>
            <h6 class="date">July 14, 2018</h6>
            <p>Recently, I was asked to proofread an essay to check for grammatical errors. My friend has always been asking me to do so throughout high school and college. And it's always been the same every time: receive his horrible essay by email and trudge through it, stopping every few seconds to cry as I try to understand what he's saying and see how to fix it.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseSeeHowItWorks">
              <p>Joking aside, this time was a little different. I only cried every few minutes. Ok, no more jokes.</p>
              <p>(On an unrelated note, it was different for another reason. When I proofread my friend's paper, I sometimes tease him through my comments only because he knows I'm not really making fun of him. What I didn't know was that this was my friend's friend's paper. Oops.)</p>
              <p>This time was different because one of the first thoughts that popped into my mind was functional programming.</p>
              <p>Having been working with Racket for the past 3 weeks, functional programming has been on my mind lately. I'm still not sure of what functional programming is actually. I guess it's partly because I'm a little uncomfortable with functional programming. I still prefer imperative programming, but only because I've been doing it for the past 4 years. My mind may change.</p>
              <p>The reason I thought of functional programming when asked to proofread for grammar was because I thought they were related. Pretty closely related. I think successfully working with them follows from knowing how to visualize the structure of their elements. (Though that could be said of almost any subject really.)</p>
              <p>Racket is driven by parentheses. Thus, getting programs to work correctly requires knowing where to put them. (For some students, it's been knowing <i>how many</i> parentheses are needed.) In fact, it's probably the main source of problems among students. At first, the biggest issue is missing the ')'. But, later on in the week, it becomes putting the ')' too early, cutting off the rest of the code and causing it to not show up on the program.</p>
              <p>Because of it's list-like nature, it's very easy to get lost in the code and see where you have to put the ')'. Knowing how to visualize the pieces of code might possibly solve ~99% of problems involving parentheses. (The 1% is knowing when to start code with '('.) By knowing when to close off parentheses, you start seeing a Racket file as pieces of code put together rather than one long wall of code.</p>
              <p>Grammar is also very dependent on structure. The biggest fundamental mistakes I think are issues with incomplete sentences and run-on sentences. Being able to visualize sentences as parts solve* these - and many others - issues. Specifically, being able to recognize the subject(s), verb(s), and modifer(s). (*I intentionally made a grammar mistake in the third sentence of this paragraph to prove a point. I intentionally made a grammar mistake in the fourth sentence of this paragraph for style reasons. <a href="#grammar_rules">#grammar_rules</a>) Yeah, I enjoyed making <a href="http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/diagrams2/one_pager1.htm" target="_blank">sentence diagrams</a> in my English class.</p>
              <p>In terms of Racket, incomplete sentences would be closing off parentheses too early and run-on sentences would be not knowing when to close off parentheses.</p>
              <p>I don't necessarily think being good at grammar implies being good at (functional) programming and vice versa. Actually, I would be surprised if there was some correlation. I do think being good at visualizing pieces of the whole will help in understanding what is going on though.</p>

            <h4 class="title">What's the Difference?</h4>
            <h6 class="date">July 12, 2018</h6>
            <p>"There is a difference between 'creepy' and 'disgusting'."</p>
            <p>A friend said that today in response to an amusing (not serious, not inappropriate) situation. That sentence immediately brought back a memory of one of my most thought-provoking experiences that had been unintentionally suppressed for several years.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseDifference">
              <p>I know I said it was one of the most thought-provoking experiences, but I unfortunately don't remember a lot of the details. I do remember it happened in my AP English Language and Composition class. On that day, we got back our papers. I don't remember the topic, but it had something to do with analyzing the author's choice of word usage. Specifically, why the author chose to use two different words when they both had the same meaning. I really wish I could remember those words right now.</p>
              <p>They were pretty much synonyms, so that's what I wrote in my paper. One had a slightly more subtle darker/negative connotation I think, but, to me, they meant the same thing.</p>
              <p>"Why are there two different words for the same thing then?" That's more or less what my teacher wrote on my paper in his messy-but-readable, authoritative handwriting. I was mind-blown. It got me thinking about how there are words that are interchangeable because they mean the same thing and why they even exist in the first place. Like, why did we need to have multiple versions of the same word if that word was perfectly fine to use?</p>
              <p>There might be an obvious difference between "creepy" and "disgusting". I don't really know how to explain what the difference is, but I guess one would be more appropriate in different situations. Regardless, my initial, immediate mental response to my friend's statement was, "Yeah, they are two different words for a reason."</p>

            <p>Here's an interesting experiment. Answer polar questions (yes-no questions) with only "yes" or "no". That's it. No extra justification or additional confirmation. Just "yes" or "no". Sounds simple enough, doesn't it?</p>
            <p>Yes.</p>

            <h4 class="title">The Point of Some Return</h4>
            <h6 class="date">June 21, 2018</h6>
            <p>The concept of "return" is a difficult one. To understand and to explain.</p>
            <p>When I first started learning how to code, I did not understand what return meant. No matter how many times the professor went over it (he wasn't bad!), I just couldn't wrap my head around it. I don't remember exactly - or even vaguely, for that matter - what words he used to explain what return does. I do remember the context in which it was introduced though.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseReturn">
              <p><code>public int addTwo(int x) {<br>&ensp; int y = x + 2;<br>&ensp; return y;<br>}</code></p>
              <p>Not the exact example, but something more or less like this was on the slides. Just a random function that did something and returned a value. Whatever return meant. If I had to guess, I imagine the professor explained return by saying it "passed back the value" or "sends the value back" or something. Back WHERE?? WHERE did the value go when it was "returned"?</p>
              <p>The curious thing about explaining return is that it's really hard to explain in words without restating the definition of return.</p>
              <p>Of course, the concept of return totally makes sense to me now. But I still don't really know how to explain it. In words anyways. If I had to try to explain it, I would probably give an example and hope that it makes sense.</p>
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-5">
                  <p><code>public int addTwo(int x) {<br>&ensp; int y = x + 2;<br>&ensp; return y;<br>}<br>int a = addTwo(3);</code></p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-3">
                  <p>Or in Python:<br>(Which might be easier to understand)</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-3">
                  <p><code>def addTwo(x):<br>&ensp; y = x + 2<br>&ensp; return y<br><br>a = addTwo(3)</code></p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>In either case, a is equal to 5.</p>
              <p>Seeing that extra line at the end (<code>a = addTwo(3)</code>) <i>along</i> with the function definition is when I finally understood return.</p>
              <p>Hmm. Now that I think about it, I could explain return without restating the definition. I would say that return is the output of a function. Besides being a piece of code that is reused to perform a task - or being <a href="#something_that_does_something">something that does something</a> - a function could be (seen as) a machine that takes in an input and spits out an output. Return is what does the spitting out.</p>

            <p>I feel so weird. So unknowledgeable. So helpless.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseImagine">
              <p>I’m a math major, so a problem like “What is (2+3i)(3+4i)” shouldn’t be too hard right? (Well, one doesn’t have to be a math major to know this). Solving this, I get:</p>
              <p>(2 × 3) + (2 × 4i) + (3i × 3) + (3i × 4i) = 6 + 8i + 9i + 12i<sup>2</sup> = 6 + 17i + 12i<sup>2</sup> = -6 + 17i</p>
              <p>Wait, what happened to the 12i<sup>2</sup>?</p>
              <p>I, along with students learning about imaginary numbers could just tell you that i<sup>2</sup> is actually equal to -1.</p>
              <p>The operative word being just.</p>
              <p>Why in the world is i<sup>2</sup> = -1? I don’t know - it just is.</p>
              <p>I’ve never really thought about what ‘i’ was. That’s why I feel so weird.</p>
              <p>I’ve never really thought about why i<sup>2</sup> = -1. That’s why I feel so unknowledgeable.</p>
              <p>I don’t really know how to explain why i<sup>2</sup> = -1. That’s why I feel so helpless.</p>
              <p>These emotions are bouncing around in my head in my Practicum in Math Tutoring class.  When we were told about “learning with meaning”, I was not expecting to feel this confused. Especially, for a topic that would normally be covered in 10 minutes (unfortunately). But this confusion only fueled my desire to realize the imaginary numbers.</p>
              <p>There's a constant battle in my head between "There must be an intuitive reason why i<sup>2</sup> = -1" and "It just is. That's the way you learned it, and that's how it shall be learned." Learning with meaning versus rote learning. It's so easy to end the battle now and give the victory to "that's the way things are".</p>
              <p>Though not deserving of the win, the latter is seemingly effective. Why spend so much time explaining why things work, when it takes so much less time to present as is? There’s only so much time to make sure these students pass these tests! It was certainly the mindset my AP Calculus teacher in high school adopted.</p>
              <p>He wasn’t a bad teacher. In fact, he was the exact opposite. Every student who has had him as a teacher will say that he is very smart, dedicated, hard-working, and caring. What other teacher would go to great lengths to provide us with notes he wrote himself to make calculus easier to read? What other teacher would make hundreds of copies of past AP exams for us to practice? What other teacher would write his own “handbook” and give them to us as study aids?</p>
              <p>We were learning calculus because of his efforts. For the past 9 years, more than 100 students, each year, have passed the AP exam, with an average of 127 students passing. His total class size each year was 150 or less. Surely, we were learning.</p>
              <p>With his dedication and concern for our success, it was obvious that there was nothing he would rather do than teach. Watching him and experiencing the results for myself made me feel the same way. I felt like I could’ve been in his shoes. And I wanted to too. Oh, except for the fact that I (then) hated public speaking.</p>
              <p>I’m still not great at it, but I’ve grown more comfortable with speaking in front of a crowd. So much so, that I recently realized the chance to help others have the same learning experience I did overshadowed my (now) dislike of public speaking. And that was before I experienced learning with meaning.</p>
              <p>So, what exactly is the “meaning” in “learning with meaning”? It is:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Drawing a number line</li>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/i/1.jpg">
                <li>Reminding that an arrow starting from 0 and pointing to 1 is “stretched” 5 times its length when multiplied by 5, and stretched in the other direction when multiplied by a negative number (or a rotation 180° counter-clockwise)</li>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/i/2.gif">
                <li>Asking “What number multiplied by itself twice gives -1?”</li>
                <li>Showing that the arrow starting from 0 and pointing to 1 can be rotated 180° counter-clockwise to point to -1 by multiplying 1 by a number (-1) once to get to -1</li>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/i/4.gif">
                <li>Showing that the arrow starting from 0 and pointing to 1 can be rotated 90° counter-clockwise, then rotated another 90° counter-clockwise to get to -1</li>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/i/5.gif">
                <li>Realizing that one rotation is one multiplication (from step #2) and two rotations is two multiplications (almost answering step #3)</li>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/i/6.gif">
                <li>Showing that when the arrow rotated 90° counter-clockwise, it pointed upward - not to any number on the number line. Not to anything in particular actually.</li>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/i/7.jpg">
                <li>Drawing a vertical number line extending upwards and downwards from that arrow and introducing it as the imaginary number line</li>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/i/8.jpg">
                <li>Showing again that the arrow starting from 0 and pointing to 1, when rotated once 90° counter-clockwise (one multiplication), points to some imaginary number, call it i</li>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/i/9.gif">
                <li>Reiterating that one 90° rotation was multiplying by i, so another 90° rotation is multiplying by i again</li>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/i/10.gif">
              </ol>
              <p>It’s certainly a lot easier to just say i<sup>2</sup> = -1, isn’t it?</p>
              <p>All of a sudden, the battle in my head ceases. The confusion fades away and is replaced by a newfound sense of empowerment. It’s a curious feeling. A little unusual, but also a little familiar. It’s the void of cluelessness and helplessness being filled with knowledge. Knowledge I never knew I needed.</p>

            <h4 class="title">Biking for the First Time</h4>
            <h6 class="date">June 7, 2018</h6>
            <p>So I rode a road bike for the first time today. It was absolutely amazing. And terrifying.</p>
            <p>Which came as a surprise to me. I learned how to ride a bike when I was like 7 or something. I've been cycling semi-seriously for maybe 7 years? Not 7 years straight, but within that time frame. And yet, riding a road bike was scary.</p>
            <p>Maybe it's because I've been riding a mountain bike all those years. For those who don't know, mountain bikes generally have thicker wheels, so it's easier to ride on different types of terrain. Road bikes have (very) thin wheels because they're meant for riding fast on flat surfaces, like roads. Can you imagine balancing your life on two wheels about as thick as your thumb?</p>
            <p>Not to mention I was riding pretty fast. Faster than I was used to anyways. Not on purpose. Road bikes are built to go fast. It's sort of like driving on the freeway for the first time. You know what to do, but the prospect of getting into an accident is pretty scary considering the fact that you're driving at such high speeds.</p>
            <p>I guess I'll have to get used to it. It's certainly a lot better than my old bike. Not just because it was a mountain bike, but because it was from Target. The main problem, for me anyways, with bikes from places like Target and Walmart is that they are heavy. Because they are built with cheap parts. They're only $200 after all.</p>
            <p>Amazing and terrifying. A pretty good combo if you ask me.</p>
            <p>Update (6/13): It took me 1 hour and 30 minutes to go 14.5 miles on my mountain bike. Google Maps estimates that it takes 1 hour and 15 minutes. I can do it in 1 hour and 5 minutes on my road bike.</p>

            <h6 class="date">June 6, 2018</h6>
            <p>Love is in the air. Weaving in and out. Bobbing up and down. Hitting me and then backing off. It hurts.</p>
            <p>Is there something about spring that brings it out? Or am I breathing the wrong air in the other seasons?</p>
            <p>Actually, it's not even love. It's something though. Something's messing with me.</p>
            <p>Spring is coming to an end. So is "whatever" it is. Maybe it does have something to do with spring. Or maybe it's just the fact that the quarter is ending. I don't know if I like it, but it'll probably come back.</p>
            <p>I'll probably not be ready for it either. I've never really been good at boxing.</p>

            <h6 class="date">May 14, 2018</h6>
            <p>Free guitar lessons! Participate in a paid study! Need tutoring? Anyone looking at me would've thought I was actually interested in what those flyers had to say. Huh, yeah right. There was only one paper I was interested in.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseSoundCrime">
              <p>Ah, there he is. Out of the corner of my eye, I see him leaving his room. I turn my head to look past him and stare intently at the door. The doorknob specifically. He doesn't lock it. As he turns around, I slowly turn my head back to look at the flyers. Thump, thump, thump. The wind blows by as he rushes past me. I pull out my phone and start walking towards his door.</p>
              <p>As a precaution, I knock on it. No answer. Ok, let's open it. Creeeeaaaaaaaak! Oh my god. Why didn't it make this sound when it was closing? Resisting the temptation to look behind me, I slip in.</p>
              <p>My eyes scan the room, taking note of where everything is placed. Whiteboard cleared of all writing. Chair pushed in all the way. A pile of papers neatly placed on the corner of his desk. Looks like this will be quick. I make my way over to the papers and quickly thumb through them, looking for my name. No... No... No...</p>
              <p>Thump, thump, thump. What!? Is that him!? Oh my god oh my god. What do I do what do I do? I pull out the chair, hide under his desk, and pull it back in. Creeeeaaaaaaaak! Followed by complete silence. My whole body tenses up. I stop breathing. Please don't sit down. Please don't sit down. I don't hear anything. Suddenly, his hand comes straight at me. My heart punches my chest and my eyes widen as I let out a small gasp. His hand stops for a moment, but then reaches for a briefcase next to me. He grabs the briefcase and pulls it out, his hand disappearing with it.</p>
              <p>Click.</p>
              <p>I let out a huge sigh after he closes the door and my whole body melts into a pile of relaxation. I wait until I can't hear his footsteps anymore. Then I slowly crawl out from under the desk, as if making a sound will send him back in. I keep my eye on the door, half-expecting it to open at any moment. Thump, thump, thump. Oh my god, he's back! Quickly, I jump back under the desk, a loud bang echoing the room when I bash my knee against the table. Thump, thump, thump. Where is he?? Thump, thump, thump. Wait a minute, that's my heart. Getting out from under the desk again, I let out another huge sigh while massaging my knee and continue sifting through the papers. No... No... No... Maybe it's in the storage cabinets. I pull out the top drawer. Locked. Next one. Also locked. They were all locked.
              <p>Disappointed, but extremely relieved at not getting caught, I start to leave. I take one last look at the room behind me, searching for anything out of the ordinary. Then I open the door.</p>
              <p>Creeeeaaaaaaaak! My heart nearly explodes and I jump up as I let out a startled gasp.</p>
              <p>Another pair of eyes is staring right at me.</p>

            <h4 class="title">The Siren Armed with Light</h4>
            <h6 class="date">May 13, 2018</h6>
            <p>There's a mysterious attractiveness to her. I don't know why it's taken me so long to realize it. I guess the phrase "not immediately pretty" applies. Now that I say it, it actually sounds a bit degrading. No, she's always been pretty. What's not immediate is why. I never noticed the way her face attracts all the light in the room. Bending every wave. Redirecting every particle. Making her face glow.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseSiren">
              <p>Yet, at the same time, her face also seems to be reflecting the light. Like a mirror. Aiming the light at whomever she wants. But instead of blinding them, she casts a warm, soft glow, inviting the target to take in the beauty. And that target is me.</p>
              <p>Is it possible she's doing this on purpose? Is she somehow able to control light like this to attract anyone she wants? Am I the only one who's noticing this?</p>
              <p>Perhaps I'm being too hopeful. I mean, why me of all people? But the more I look at her, the more she seems to be redirecting the light at me. And she's doing this without looking in my direction. As if she knows that she has my attention, but wants to keep me hanging at the edge of my seat. Am I being too hopeful?</p>
              <p>Finally she looks at me. I immediately look away, the way one does when caught staring. My face feels a little warmer. I can't tell if it's because I'm getting red or because the light is getting more intense. After a moment of embarrassment, I look back at her. Is it me or is her smile a little bit bigger? Not in a devious way, but in a relieved way. It makes her face even prettier. I can't help but smile too.</p>
              <p>As I'm walking, I think about her face. The way it draws the light towards her and reflects it towards me at the same time. My heart flutters and skips a beat. I look behind me, hoping that she's around. Hoping I can see her face again.</p>
              <p>I see her.</p>
              <p>Her face is still as pretty as I last saw it. Still radiating. Still glowing. Except I don't feel the warm glow anymore. She's aiming the light at another guy. Another guy who's holding her hand. Basking in the warmth of her light. I look away, with mixed feelings in my heart. Sadness. Jealousy. A little bit of wistfulness. The world seems a bit darker without her face lighting it up. It's ok, it's not too dark. At least the sun is shining for him.</p>

            <h6 class="date">May 12, 2018</h6>
            <p>A woman is walking towards me. She looks at me. I start to open my mouth, the word "Hi" ready to jump out. Then she gives me a weird look. I close my mouth before the letter h escapes and walk past her, not saying anything. I'm confused.</p>
            <p>Oh, right. My hair. I totally forgot about my haircut. I forgot it was ugly.</p>
            <p>It's only been two weeks and, already, I feel normal. Even with the right side of my head shaved to a buzz cut and the left side mostly untouched. Actually, I feel more than normal.</p>
            <p>I feel strangely confident.</p>
            <p>Part of it is that I actually like this style. Which is weird. I don't think anyone would admit this hairstyle looks cool - much less get it. However, two people with whom I have familiarized myself have complimented it. Thank you very much. But not the response I was really looking for. I guess that makes the compliments so much more meaningful though. Perhaps there is some sort of beauty in this ugliness I have carved for myself.</p>
            <p>The other part is, I finally feel like I have some sort of defining feature that makes me stand out. Not that I cut my hair for that reason, but it is a rather nice consequence. For a good part of my life, I just wanted to not be judged. I wanted to be just another person you saw and never thought about again. I wanted to blend in wherever I went, like another brick in the wall.</p>
            <p>I never realized the light was so comforting.</p>

            <h4 class="title">Grammar Rules(!) (get it?)</h4>
            <h6 class="date">May 11, 2018</h6>
            <p>I'm a grammar Nazi. Well, ok. I used to be. If you somehow stumbled upon this website and read my other posts, you might think my grammar is a little lacking. I admit, my grasp on correct grammar rules and mechanics isn't as good as it once was. Not to brag, but my score on the English section of the ACT was 34/36. The point is, grammar came easily to me.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseGrammar">
              <p>What I liked about grammar was all the rules. A comma must be placed before a conjunction separating two independent clauses. A dependent clause cannot stand alone as a sentence (incomplete sentences). A sentence cannot have more than two conjunctions separating independent clauses or predicates (run-ons). A phrase describing an object must be placed next to the object being described (dangling modifiers). The last item in a list must have an appropriate conjunction before it, like "and" or "or". A sentence shouldn't end with a preposition. That's probably my favorite.</p>
              <p>So. Many. Rules.</p>
              <p>Even the word "grammar" sounds so proper and formal doesn't it?</p>
              <p>I was born into the near-ludicrous, strict world of English. I stayed in it for years. Then I left. I no longer care about whether I should've put a comma at a certain place, or whether I'm using dashes correctly. I no longer care about maintaining consistent verb tense or a single point of view. I no longer care about forming complete sentences or cutting up run-ons. Because, in the end, it doesn't really matter for me anymore. I believe that adhering to grammar rules is a little bit inhibiting, and breaking those rules allows me to express my ideas in a much better - or at least a more interesting - way.</p>
              <p>There are some rules that shouldn't be broken though. Like subject-verb agreement. Using could've instead of could of. Eh, there aren't a lot. Or I just can't remember them right now.</p>
              <p>I'm on the fence about using the correct comparative/superlative form of an adjective. From my experience, this is probably the most common mistake both native and non-native English speakers make (as a result of the fast-paced nature of conversation). On one hand, the meaning of "more better" is totally understandable. On the other hand, "better" is <i>already</i> the correct comparative form and should actually be used instead. An even harder one to detect, especially in conversation, is using the superlative in a situation with only two objects and using the comparative with more than three.</p>
              <p>Really, the only reason why I'm writing about grammar is because I started this "free" writing. Someone, upon reviewing my previous posts, told me that I had a strong sense of grammar rules. Wait, what? My post was scattered with grammatical errors. (Or so I thought at the time. Turns out, the ones she read didn't have as much as I thought it did.)</p>
              <p>It turns out there's a general consensus that breaking rules is ok when you understand them and why you're breaking them. I don't really know if I understand why I'm breaking a rule. Does "cuz it sounds good to me" count? It's pretty much the only reason why I write anything the way it is. Like this.</p>
              <p>Do you have to be good at grammar to be a good writer? I'm not a good writer so I don't know. Part of me still thinks that content is more important. One can follow the conventions of English perfectly but write boring garbage. Another part of me thinks that wonderful ideas can lose their meaning through poorly structured sentences.</p>
              <p>A small part of me thinks, "Who cares? (sometimes "Who's reading?") This is fun. Just forget about everything and write."</p>

            <p>So you're writer's block. I was expecting something ... a little more ... well, more.</p>
            <p>I can't even see you. Not because of your size, but because you have no form. Yet I can feel your presence looming over me. Taunting me. You enjoy seeing me suffer don't you? I suppose it's because I'm a fresh target.</p>
            <p>Oh, you've been watching me ever since I could write? I wonder why I've never noticed you before then. I swear I didn't avoid you on purpose. I've heard about you, but you were just another one of those things I thought were never going to happen to me.</p>
            <p>I've done so much writing in school though. Why have you never attacked me? Is it because prompts and deadlines are barriers you can't get through? Fine, I'll admit it if you won't. They're barriers I can't get through. Give me a prompt and my imagination becomes a tightrope on which I must balance. One small step away, and I fall. Give me a deadline and my imagination quickly runs to meet it, not stopping to enjoy the scenery.</p>
            <p>Oh, that's it isn't it? You feed off of creativity don't you? You're nothing but a block filled with other people's thoughts. And now mine.</p>
            <p>I'll let you have this win. I guess I'll have to get used to your presence. Unless I stop thinking. But that's not poss-.</p>

            <p>"Where is everybody?" Said Enrico Fermi.</p>
            <p>Our universe is enormous. And very old. Yet, over the course of 14 billion years, Earth is still the only known place able to sustain life? A tiny speck in the possibly infinite expanse of space, and there's only one Earth? This is the Fermi paradox.</p>
            <p>What if aliens do exist, but they're purposely avoiding contact with us? Watching us, like we're animals at the zoo. This is the zoo hypothesis.</p>
            <p>What if, we could find another Earth, and watch how life evolves? Would we see the same thing happen on that Earth as it did on this one? Plants, animals, dinosaurs, early humans, modern-day humans. The Stone Age, the Renaissance, World War 2. The lightbulb, phone, car, computer. Religion, language, culture.</p>
            <p>Would life on that Earth go through the exact same process that life on our Earth did? Would those people make the same advancements and the same mistakes? Or did all of whatever occured on our Earth just happen by chance, and that Earth has creatures we have never seen; inventions we have never made; ideas we have never thought. What if they're aliens to us, and we're aliens to them? This is what I call the greatest experiment.</p>

            <h4 class="title">Going Against the Grain</h4>
            <h6 class="date">May 5, 2018</h6>
            <p>Have you ever held something in your hands and you know what to do with it, but you don't do it because you tell yourself you don't know how to do it?</p>
            <p>Ok, so maybe I really didn't know how to cut hair - much less my own - but I knew what I had to do with the clippers in my hand. Yet, I never put them against my head. I looked back and forth between the instructions and my head in the mirror, hoping that something in my brain would just "click" and I would suddenly know what to do. The instructions were clear enough: split your head into three sections and, starting at the bottom, cut against the grain. Yet, I never put them against my head.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseGrain">
              <p>Ironically, my somewhat-irrational fear of messing up was preventing me from cutting. Ironic, because I wanted to have an "ugly" haircut. Somewhat-irrational, because it would grow back anyways. However, the only thought going through my mind was, "Once I cut my hair off, there's no undoing it". That idea gripped my hand and held it in place, as if it was blackmailing my brain. Telling me, "Don't do it, or else".</p>
              <p>But my brain isn't always rational.</p>
              <p>Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Oh wow. I did it. I actually did it. It wasn't that bad. And it was so liberating! I felt as if I had broken off chains I didn't even know were weighing me down. In a way, I was free - free from the expectations of getting a good haircut. Free from my boring, generic, could-be-anybody look. Free from myself. I changed to a smaller guard and kept going.</p>
              <p>I actually didn't cut off a lot of hair. But it was enough to make people stare at me and wonder what happened. Which was what I wanted, in a way. Not to be some weirdo with a horrible sense of fasion or no sense of self-respect. But to be someone different.</p>
              <p>Someone new.</p>

            <h4 class="title">They Say Teaching Is the Best Way to Learn</h4>
            <h6 class="date">May 3, 2018</h6>
            <p>A few weeks ago, I read part of Habits of Mind: An Organizing Principle for Mathematics Curricula by Al Cuoco, E. Paul Goldenberg, and June Mark. They touched upon a point - or rather, centered their argument around a point - that I was slowly experiencing, but never really realized until now: math isn't really about knowing all the different shapes and their geometric properties or knowing how to do complex calculations with a ton of variables and symbols. Math is about knowing how to think.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseLearningMath">
              <p>Being a good student - or, perhaps not mutually exclusive, a blind and naive one - I never questioned what I was learning. I never asked myself, "Why do we have to know how to complete the square?" or "Why do we need to learn how to prove two triangles are congruent?". I just did them. Sure, some things are useful, like knowing how to calculate area and computing percentages, but when and how often am I ever going to be in a situation where it would be useful to know that sin(&pi;/6) is 1/2?</p>
              <p>I've been asked by high school students before, "Do you need to know this for college?" My simple answer: "No." My more accurate but perhaps not the most motivating answer: "No, I haven't done this in forever." I already know what they're thinking, even if they don't say it out loud - "Then why do we need to learn this?" My high school self would've just said, "I don't know, just do it and get it over with."</p>
              <p>For the past few days, the class for which I've been tutoring has been learning about how to prove triangles are congruent. Admittedly, I don't remember much about it. But I never realized how similar doing geometry proofs was to doing higher-level math proofs for theorems. You start with what you're given, use your knowledge to find out what else you can claim, and make your conclusions.</p>
              <p>A student asked for help proving triangles are congruent. I had no idea how to do it. I immediately started thinking, "Well, what do we know from the picture?", "Can we say this?", "Will that help?". That's when I realized that those were the types of questions they should've been asking themselves. Learning how to prove triangles are congruent isn't about making sure you know (and remember) about the side-side-side postulate or side-angle-side postulate. It's about looking at the picture and using what you know to work towards the last step in the proof. In other words, it's about learning how to think and problem solve.</p>
              <p>"Do you need to know this for college?" Probably not, at least to pass your classes anyways. I mean, you might be in a cryptography class where you have to complete the square, or you might be solving a combinatorial problem involving triangles. What's more important, I now have learned, is realizing you're learning about critical thinking - not about triangles.</p>

            <p>There's a mysterious attractiveness to her. It's not a "love-at-first-sight" sort of thing, but I can't look away no matter how hard I try. I manage to break my gaze once but it quickly makes its way back to her. She hasn't noticed me yet. And part of me is hoping that she won't.</p>
            <p>The other part of me is desperately screaming at her, trying to get her to look at me. Deep down, that part of me knows it won't work though. Not just the screaming. But the relationship as well. Or, at least that's what I tell myself.</p>
            <p>So the shy side overpowers the longing one, and I remain where I am. She never looks at me once. I feel kind of relieved, but a little wounded at the same time. I won't have to embarrass myself this time. Then her face blends into the crowd and becomes unnoticeable, the same way my face probably looks to her. I didn't know if I was ready for her to leave yet, but it was already too late.</p>
            <p>As I'm walking, I play out scenarios in my head of me approaching her and imagine how "suave" I would be in each one. My thoughts are interrupted by a finger tap on my shoulder. I look behind me, expecting no one in particular, and see her face. She's looking at me. Smiling at me.</p> 
            <p>Noticing me.</p>

            <h6 class="date">April 30, 2018</h6>
            <p>I'm sitting in a chair, but I don't fit in it. It's a normal, plastic chair that an average-sized adult could sit on. It's a normal, plastic chair behind a normal-sized table in a normal-sized room. It's a normal, plastic chair.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseCulture">
              <p>It's early in the morning, and I'm in a high school classroom. If you walk into the room and look around, you would see a bunch of students. If you happened to look at me, you would think I was just another student. There was nothing about my faded blue sweater, light gray t-shirt, and coal black jeans that made me look different from everyone else. Just another student. Yet I didn't feel like I was one of them. Yeah, I was a college student tutoring at a high school. But that wasn't it. After all, I was still a student, and I had been in their shoes only 4 years ago. I was sitting in a normal, plastic chair just like they all were. The problem was, I wasn't part of their "student culture" anymore.</p>
              <p>I wasn't actually "part" of it, just around people who were. It was normal to hate school and, therefore, normal to not try in anything school-related. I get it. It's so much more fun to be talking with friends, and it's so much easier to be on our phones. It also doesn't help that everything coming out of the teacher's mouth either isn't making sense or is just plain BORING. Those people around me weren't bad people, but I could see why they wouldn't pay attention in class or skip it altogether.</p>
              <p>I'm sure everyone wasn't like that - they just chose to present themselves that way to fit in with everyone else. I mean, that's why nerds get bullied and picked on right? Pretty soon, you start hearing things like "I hate school" or "I don't wanna do this s***" and murmurs of agreement everywhere you go.</p>
              <p>At my high school, that type of student culture wasn't as harsh as I may have made it seem. Or I was just at the "wrong" place at the "wrong" time. Either way, I thought I left it behind coming into college. Selfishly, I thought to myself, "I won't have to feel uncomfortable being around those type of people ever again". But here I am now, at a high school helping students I so selfishly wanted to avoid. Ouch.</p>
              <p>Again, they weren't bad people - I just didn't belong with them.</p>
              <p>It's early in the morning, and I'm sitting in chair in a high school classroom. A normal, plastic chair behind a normal-sized table in a normal-sized room. I still don't feel quite right in it, but, this time, I feel slightly more comfortable. Because next to me, is another student who, although he doesn't like school, is at least willing to try.</p>
              <p>When I get out of my chair, I look back, and I see something strange in the corner of my eye. The chair looks different. Then I blink and everything is back to normal. I'm probably imagining things. After all, I probably would've noticed if I was sitting on a cushion the whole time.</p>

            <p>What is a function? Those of you familiar with programming might say that a function is a piece of code that is reused throughout your code to perform a task. Those of you thinking in terms of higher-level math might (loosely) define it as a mapping from a set to another set. Those of you more comfortable with lower-level math might describe it as ... well, I'm not sure actually.</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseFunction">
              <p>I remember being asked this question at an interview. It was for a tutoring position where I would have to help children with programming. So I had to explain what a function was so that a child could understand.</p>
              <p>This question - a rubber ball to the prepared, a spear to those who weren't - was thrown at me. Its sharp point grazed my brain. My brain stopped for a few seconds in shock, realizing what could've happened if it had been thrown a few more millimeters to the side. I had been programming with functions for 2 years and I still didn't know what they were!? My brain started running around in circles. It fell, got back up, started running, fell again, got back up again, started running again ... When it finally stopped to rest, it came up with "a function is something that takes in an input, does something with it, and returns an output".</p>
              <p>Not the best answer, but the best I could come up with in such a short amount of time. After saying it, I immediately thought of functions with no parameters and void signatures (functions with no input and no output). But that wasn't the main issue with my answer. My answer was no better than telling you that a function is something that does something.</p>
              <p>I didn't get the position, which was no surprise to me. It wasn't just that question that killed my chances, but that's a different story. That spear left a lasting impression on me that still hurts to this day. How many concepts have I been using for a long time without thinking about what they were?</p>
              <p>How many of those do I actually know how to explain?</p>

            <p>I've never fancied myself a great writer. Or even a writer, for that matter. In fact, I don't even know why I'm writing this. Not just this post, but this sentence.</p>
            <p>This word.</p>
            <p>This letter.</p>
            <p>Letter. Maybe that's it. Maybe I'm just writing a letter and mailing it to no one in particular. Maybe someone will open their mailbox and find this letter waiting to be opened and read. Or maybe it will get lost in the mail and never be read.</p>
            <p>I suppose this would be the beginning of this blog. The problem with the beginning is you never know what's at the end or what you might find along the way. Perhaps that's not such a bad thing. But does the road through the beginning always have to be such a long and difficult one? There are no other roads and I've already come this far. So I might as well just keep going. Who knows? This might turn out to be a fun adventure.</p>
